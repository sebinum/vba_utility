# Setting up Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)
VBA is a fairly old application and not up to date with modern IDE standards. There are some ways to adapt VBA by changing some setting or even adding add-ins.

## Formatting & Tools
The following formatting and tools were suggested from [GollyJer's](https://stackoverflow.com/users/25197/gollyjer) [Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48916639) 
### 1 Deactivate Auto Syntax Check
Each time you jump to a new line with syntax errors in you existing line of code, you will get a pop-up. To deactivte the pop-up (errors will still get highlighted) in the Visual Basics Editor do the following:

***Tools -> Options -> Editor Tab -> deselect*** `Auto Syntax Check`

### 2 Change Font
For a more readable / modern Font that is included in the standard Windows Font in the Visual Basics Editor do the following:

***Tools -> Options -> Format Tab -> change the Font to*** `Consolas (Western)` ***and the size to*** `11`

### 3 Make Edit Toolbar accessible
For easier commenting / uncommenting of code to make the Edit toolbar accessible in the taskbar in Visual Basics Editor do the following:
***Right Click the toolbar / menu -> Select the*** `Edit` ***toolbar, so it will appear as an additional toolbar which can be drag & dropped at convenience***

### 4 Add-ins - Ruberduck
Ruberduck is an add-in that adds a wide set of feature to VBA (such as auto-indenting). According to their webpage they:
> Bring the VBE into this century 
> Or help us do it! Rubberduck is a very active open-source COM add-in project that integrates with the Visual Basic Editor to enable the features every programmer wants to have in their IDE. From unit testing to code inspections and refactorings, programming in VBA will never be the same.

***Download and install the rubberduck extension***
